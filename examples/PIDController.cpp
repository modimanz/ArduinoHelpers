/**
 * In this example, the PIDController class's constructor initializes the PID controller with the desired gains.
 * The calculate method calculates the control value based on the current setpoint and process variable (the actual
 * measured value), and returns this control value.
 *
 * Keep in mind, a PID controller isn't magic -- you'll still need to tune your Kp, Ki, and Kd values for your specific
 * system, which can often be an iterative process. Also note that the integral term can cause the system to overshoot
 * and oscillate if it gets too large (this is known as "integral wind-up"), so in a more robust implementation you
 * might want to include code to limit its size.
